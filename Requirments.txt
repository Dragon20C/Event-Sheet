### What an Event Sheet Is:

- **Visual logic system**: Organizes game logic without the need for traditional coding.
- **Event-Action structure**: Events are conditions that, when met, trigger actions.
- **Conditions**: The "if" part of logic, checking for specific game states or inputs (e.g., collision, key press).
- **Actions**: Executed when conditions are true (e.g., moving a character, changing health).
- **Sub-events**: Nested events that run if the parent event is true, allowing complex behaviors.
- **Variables**: Store data (e.g., scores, player health) that can be modified or checked in events.
- **Event Groups**: Organize events into groups, which can be enabled or disabled based on the game state.
- **Loops**: Repeat actions or events (e.g., spawn multiple enemies).
- **Functions**: Reusable blocks of logic for efficiency and cleaner design.
- **Top-down execution**: Events are processed in the order they appear in the sheet.

### How to Implement Event Sheets in Your Own Game Engine:

1. **Create an Event Manager System**:
   - Build a system to manage events (conditions) and actions.
   - Each event has a list of conditions and a list of actions tied to it.

2. **Define Event and Action Structures**:
   - **Event**: Has conditions to check (e.g., "Is the player pressing a button?").
   - **Action**: What happens when the conditions are true (e.g., "Move the player").
   - Use a base class/interface for events and actions for extensibility.

3. **Create Conditions**:
   - Implement a system to evaluate conditions, such as checking input states, collision detection, or timers.
   - Conditions could be functions that return a boolean (e.g., `is_key_pressed()` or `is_colliding()`).

4. **Develop Actions**:
   - Define various actions like moving an object, changing a variable, or playing a sound.
   - Each action should be a function or a command that modifies game objects or states.

5. **Event Processing Loop**:
   - Every game frame, check each event in the event sheet.
   - Evaluate the conditions for each event.
   - If all conditions are met, execute the corresponding actions.

6. **Add Sub-Events**:
   - Allow events to have sub-events, creating hierarchical relationships between events.
   - Sub-events are checked and executed only if the parent eventâ€™s conditions are true.

7. **Implement Variables**:
   - Add support for global and local variables that can be used in conditions or modified by actions.
   - Store variables for things like player health, scores, or enemy states.

8. **Create Event Groups**:
   - Build a way to organize events into groups, with the ability to enable/disable entire groups based on game state (e.g., pause menu, cutscenes).

9. **Add Loops and Iterations**:
   - Implement loop conditions, such as for-loops and while-loops, to repeat actions multiple times (e.g., spawn enemies in a wave).

10. **Functions for Reusability**:
   - Create reusable functions or macros that encapsulate common event-action patterns (e.g., spawn multiple objects, reset player position).

11. **Build a Visual Editor (Optional)**:
   - Design a drag-and-drop interface for the event system, making it easier to build event sheets visually.
   - Use UI components to represent events, conditions, and actions.
